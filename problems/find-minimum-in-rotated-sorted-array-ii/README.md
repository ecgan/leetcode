# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

LeetCode #: [154](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/)

Difficulty: Hard

Topics: Array, Binary Search.

## Problem

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

Example 1:

```text
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```
