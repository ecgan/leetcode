LeetCode #: [283](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

Difficulty: Easy

Topics: Array, Two Pointers.

## Problem

Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:

```text
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

* You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
* Minimize the total number of operations.
