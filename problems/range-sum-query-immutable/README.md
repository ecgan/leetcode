# Range Sum Query - Immutable

LeetCode #: [303](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable/)

Difficulty: Easy

Topic: Dynamic Programming.

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, find the sum of the elements between indices `i` and `j` (`i â‰¤ j`), inclusive.

Example:

```text
Given nums = [-2, 0, 3, -5, 2, -1]

sumRange(0, 2) -> 1
sumRange(2, 5) -> -1
sumRange(0, 5) -> -3
```

Note:

- You may assume that the array does not change.
- There are many calls to `sumRange` function.
