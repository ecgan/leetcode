# Single Number III

LeetCode #: [260](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-iii/)

Difficulty: Medium

Topics: Bit Manipulation.

## Problem

Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

Example:

```text
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```

Note:

- The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
- Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?
