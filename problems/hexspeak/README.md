# Hexspeak

LeetCode #: [1271](https://leetcode.com/problems/hexspeak/)

Difficulty: Easy

Topic: Math, string.

## Problem

A decimal number can be converted to its Hexspeak representation by first converting it to an uppercase hexadecimal string, then replacing all occurrences of the digit `0` with the letter `O`, and the digit `1` with the letter `I`.  Such a representation is valid if and only if it consists only of the letters in the set `{"A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "I", "O"}`.

Given a string `num` representing a decimal integer `N`, return the Hexspeak representation of `N` if it is valid, otherwise return `"ERROR"`.

```text
Example 1:

Input: num = "257"
Output: "IOI"
Explanation:  257 is 101 in hexadecimal.
```

```text
Example 2:

Input: num = "3"
Output: "ERROR"
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= N <= 10^12`
- There are no leading zeros in the given string.
- All answers must be in uppercase letters.
