# Decompress Run-Length Encoded List

LeetCode #: [1313](https://leetcode.com/problems/decompress-run-length-encoded-list/)

Difficulty: Easy

Topics: Array.

## Problem

We are given a list `nums` of integers representing a list compressed with run-length encoding.

Consider each adjacent pair of elements `[a, b] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]]` (with `i >= 0`).  For each such pair, there are `a` elements with value `b` in the decompressed list.

Return the decompressed list.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,4,4,4]
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `nums.length % 2 == 0`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
