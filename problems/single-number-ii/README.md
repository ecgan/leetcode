# Single Number II

LeetCode #: [137](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)

Difficulty: Medium

Topics: Bit Manipulation.

## Problem

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

```text
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [0,1,0,1,0,1,99]
Output: 99
```
