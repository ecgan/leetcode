# Arranging Coins

LeetCode #: [441](https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/)

Difficulty: Easy

Topics: Math, Binary Search.

## Problem

You have a total of `n` coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every `k`-th row must have exactly `k` coins.

Given `n`, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

`n` is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

```text
n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

Example 2:

```text
n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```
