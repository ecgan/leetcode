# Hamming Distance

LeetCode #: [461](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/)

Difficulty: Easy.

Topics: Bit Manipulation.

## Problems

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:

- 0 ≤ `x`, `y` < 2^31.

Example:

```text
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
