# Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

LeetCode #: [129](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-root-to-leaf-numbers/)

Difficulty: Medium

Topic: Tree, Depth-first Search.

## Problem

Given a binary tree containing digits from `0-9` only, each root-to-leaf path could represent a number.

An example is the root-to-leaf path `1->2->3` which represents the number `123`.

Find the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers.

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

Example:

```text
Input: [1,2,3]
    1
   / \
  2   3
Output: 25
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 1->2 represents the number 12.
The root-to-leaf path 1->3 represents the number 13.
Therefore, sum = 12 + 13 = 25.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: [4,9,0,5,1]
    4
   / \
  9   0
 / \
5   1
Output: 1026
Explanation:
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->5 represents the number 495.
The root-to-leaf path 4->9->1 represents the number 491.
The root-to-leaf path 4->0 represents the number 40.
Therefore, sum = 495 + 491 + 40 = 1026.
```

## Complexity Analysis

Time complexity: O(n). We iterate through every node in the tree once.

Space complexity: O(h) where h is the height of the tree. Space cost is the recursive stack size.
