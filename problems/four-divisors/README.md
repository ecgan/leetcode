# Four Divisors

LeetCode #: [1390](https://leetcode.com/problems/four-divisors/)

Difficulty: Medium.

Topics: Math.

## Problems

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors.

If there is no such integer in the array, return `0`.

Example 1:

```text
Input: nums = [21,4,7]
Output: 32
Explanation:
21 has 4 divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21
4 has 3 divisors: 1, 2, 4
7 has 2 divisors: 1, 7
The answer is the sum of divisors of 21 only.
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
