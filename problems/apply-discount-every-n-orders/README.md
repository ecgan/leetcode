# Apply Discount Every n Orders

LeetCode #: [1357](https://leetcode.com/problems/apply-discount-every-n-orders/)

Difficulty: Medium

Topics: Design.

## Problem

There is a sale in a supermarket, there will be a `discount` every `n` customer.

There are some products in the supermarket where the id of the `i-th` product is `products[i]` and the price per unit of this product is `prices[i]`.

The system will count the number of customers and when the `n-th` customer arrive he/she will have a `discount` on the bill. (i.e if the cost is `x` the new cost is `x - (discount * x) / 100`). Then the system will start counting customers again.

The customer orders a certain amount of each product where `product[i]` is the id of the `i-th` product the customer ordered and `amount[i]` is the number of units the customer ordered of that product.

Implement the `Cashier` class:

* `Cashier(int n, int discount, int[] products, int[] prices)` Initializes the object with `n`, the `discount`, the `products` and their `prices`.
* `double getBill(int[] product, int[] amount)` returns the value of the bill and apply the discount if needed. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

Example 1:

```text
Input
["Cashier","getBill","getBill","getBill","getBill","getBill","getBill","getBill"]
[[3,50,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[100,200,300,400,300,200,100]],[[1,2],[1,2]],[[3,7],[10,10]],[[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]],[[4],[10]],[[7,3],[10,10]],[[7,5,3,1,6,4,2],[10,10,10,9,9,9,7]],[[2,3,5],[5,3,2]]]
Output
[null,500.0,4000.0,800.0,4000.0,4000.0,7350.0,2500.0]
Explanation
Cashier cashier = new Cashier(3,50,[1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[100,200,300,400,300,200,100]);
cashier.getBill([1,2],[1,2]);                        // return 500.0, bill = 1 * 100 + 2 * 200 = 500.
cashier.getBill([3,7],[10,10]);                      // return 4000.0
cashier.getBill([1,2,3,4,5,6,7],[1,1,1,1,1,1,1]);    // return 800.0, The bill was 1600.0 but as this is the third customer, he has a discount of 50% which means his bill is only 1600 - 1600 * (50 / 100) = 800.
cashier.getBill([4],[10]);                           // return 4000.0
cashier.getBill([7,3],[10,10]);                      // return 4000.0
cashier.getBill([7,5,3,1,6,4,2],[10,10,10,9,9,9,7]); // return 7350.0, Bill was 14700.0 but as the system counted three more customers, he will have a 50% discount and the bill becomes 7350.0
cashier.getBill([2,3,5],[5,3,2]);                    // return 2500.0
```

Constraints:

* `1 <= n <= 10^4`
* `0 <= discount <= 100`
* `1 <= products.length <= 200`
* `1 <= products[i] <= 200`
* There are not repeated elements in the array `products`.
* `prices.length == products.length`
* `1 <= prices[i] <= 1000`
* `1 <= product.length <= products.length`
* `product[i]` exists in `products.`
* `amount.length == product.length`
* `1 <= amount[i] <= 1000`
* At most `1000` calls will be made to `getBill`.
* Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
