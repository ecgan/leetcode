LeetCode #: [60](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence/)

Difficulty: Medium

Topics: Math, Backtracking.

## Problem

The set `[1,2,3,...,n]` contains a total of n! unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:

1. `"123"`
2. `"132"`
3. `"213"`
4. `"231"`
5. `"312"`
6. `"321"`

Given n and k, return the k-th permutation sequence.

Note:

- Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.

Example 1:

```text
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```
