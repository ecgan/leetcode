# Number Complement

LeetCode #: [476](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/)

Difficulty: Easy

Topic: Bit Manipulation.

## Problem

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Example 1:

```text
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

Note:

- The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
- You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
- This question is the same as 1009: [https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/](https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/)
