# H-Index II

LeetCode #: [275](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/)

Difficulty: Medium.

Topics: Binary Search.

## Problems

Given an array of citations sorted in ascending order (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

```text
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: 
[0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```
             
Note:

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

Follow up:

- This is a follow up problem to [H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/), where citations is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
- Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
