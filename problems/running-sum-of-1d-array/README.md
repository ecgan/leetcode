# Running Sum of 1d Array

LeetCode #: [1480](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/)

Difficulty: Easy

Topics: Array.

## Problem

Given an array `nums`. We define a running sum of an array as `runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i])`.

Return the running sum of `nums`.

Example 1:

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].
```

Example 3:

```text
Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
