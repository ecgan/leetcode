# Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

LeetCode #: [107](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal-ii/)

Difficulty: Easy.

Topics: Tree, Breadth-first Search.

## Problem 

Given a binary tree, return the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

For example:
Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

```text
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

return its bottom-up level order traversal as:

```text
[
  [15,7],
  [9,20],
  [3]
]
```
