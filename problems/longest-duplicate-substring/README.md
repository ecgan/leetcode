# Longest Duplicate Substring

LeetCode #: [1044](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-duplicate-substring/)

Difficulty: Hard

Topics: Hash Table, Binary Search.

## Problem

Given a string `S`, consider all duplicated substrings: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times.  (The occurrences may overlap.)

Return any duplicated substring that has the longest possible length.  (If `S` does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is `""`.)

Example 1:

```text
Input: "banana"
Output: "ana"
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: "abcd"
Output: ""
```

Note:

- `2 <= S.length <= 10^5`
- `S` consists of lowercase English letters.
