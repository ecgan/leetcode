Difficulty: Medium

Topic: Array, Two Pointers.

## Problem

Given an array `nums` of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in `nums` such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example:

```text
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```
