Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters `1` or `0`.

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`
- Each string is either `"0"` or doesn't contain any leading zero.
