LeetCode #: [53](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/)

Difficulty: Easy

Topics: Dynamic Programming.

## Problem

Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

Example:

```text
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```
