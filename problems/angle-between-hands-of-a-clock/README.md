Given two numbers, `hour` and `minutes`. Return the smaller angle (in sexagesimal units) formed between the `hour` and the `minute` hand.

Example 1:

```text
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 30
Output: 165
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 0
Output: 0
```

Constraints:

* `1 <= hour <= 12`
* `0 <= minutes <= 59`
* Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
