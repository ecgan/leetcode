# Perform String Shifts

LeetCode #: None. This is a new special question from [30-Day LeetCoding Challenge - Week 2](https://leetcode.com/explore/featured/card/30-day-leetcoding-challenge/529/week-2/3299/).

## Problem

You are given a string `s` containing lowercase English letters, and a matrix `shift`, where `shift[i] = [direction, amount]`:

- `direction` can be `0` (for left shift) or `1` (for right shift).
- `amount` is the amount by which string `s` is to be shifted.
- A left shift by 1 means remove the first character of `s` and append it to the end.
- Similarly, a right shift by 1 means remove the last character of `s` and add it to the beginning.

Return the final string after all operations.

Example 1:

```text
Input: s = "abc", shift = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: "cab"
Explanation:
[0,1] means shift to left by 1. "abc" -> "bca"
[1,2] means shift to right by 2. "bca" -> "cab"
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: s = "abcdefg", shift = [[1,1],[1,1],[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: "efgabcd"
Explanation:  
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "abcdefg" -> "gabcdef"
[1,1] means shift to right by 1. "gabcdef" -> "fgabcde"
[0,2] means shift to left by 2. "fgabcde" -> "abcdefg"
[1,3] means shift to right by 3. "abcdefg" -> "efgabcd"
```

Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` only contains lower case English letters.
- `1 <= shift.length <= 100`
- `shift[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= shift[i][0] <= 1`
- `0 <= shift[i][1] <= 100`
