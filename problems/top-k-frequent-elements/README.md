# Top K Frequent Elements

LeetCode #: [347](https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/)

Difficulty: Medium

Topic: Hash Table, Heap.

## Problem

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

Example 1:

```text
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 2:

```text
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```

Note:

- You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
- Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
- It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of the top k frequent elements is unique.
- You can return the answer in any order.
